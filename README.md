# ELA_routine_data_wrangling_QAQC
This is where we keep all the code for the data wrangling, processing, and QA/QC we do on our routinely collected data and samples (mainly LTER, but can be for other projects). Examples include calculating epi temps, thermocline depths, light extinction coefficients, and QA/QC on chem lab data.
